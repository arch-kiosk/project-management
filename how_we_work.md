# Types of information

## field project information
  - we develop specifications for field projects using either 
    - a github file and the usual github pull-request mechanism for collaboration
    - or a google doc and the comments etc.
  - the project repository's readme should point to all the important specs (be it google docs or github markdown files)
  - when a spec file has reached a point of implementation (e.g. for a field season) it should always be stored in the repository as a doc or something.
  - those specs can be used for testing
  - a dream: those specs can be handed out to members of those field projects so that they understand the workflow and conventions
  
### typical specs
  - workflow(s) in the field, lab, and post-season
  - reporting forms
    
## software documentation / user's manual
  - we keep to dokuwiki for documentation for the time being
  - for the user's manual we will create a new, empty wiki
  - Lutz will still do some research on publishing documentation via GitHub Pages, but that mustn't keep us from working on it in the wiki.
  - documentation for developers will be kept in our main wiki for the time being.
   
## tickets / issues
   - we use a single communal repository "arch-kiosk-office" for all software related tickets (including projects). That repo must be public so that issues can have more than one assignee.
   - Every field-project will have its own project; whenever a ticket is somehow specific to a project it should be added to that project. We don't use labels anymore for that purpose. 
   - we'll keep project management a separate repository for issues related only to general management of the project (thinking about grants, finding collaborators, organizing workflows etc.)
   - Lutz is using a seprate repo to keep tasks and files for research

## files
  - field-project related files should be kept in the field projet's repo. They are curated. Only store files that are really necessary as samples. Don't store a ton of photos just for fun
  - ton of photos, stuff to look at temporarily etc. we keep whereever. It doesn't matter because all we really store for the project is the gist. And that should go in a ticket or a spec document or somesuch. The stuff should not be necessary anymore or a small sample should be stored only in the repo.

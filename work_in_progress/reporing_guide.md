# Kiosk Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it to the administrators of Kiosk for consideration by the conduct working group by emailing the project manager at  
laurel_bestock@brown.edu. **All reports will be kept confidential**.  In some cases, we may determine that a public statement is a required response. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.  
  
  
Because Kiosk is currently a very small operation, the working group is assembled on an ad hoc basis. It consists of three members of the Kiosk team, and meets with the advisement of the Brown University Ombuds. If the violation being reported includes the project manager, the report of violation should be sent to XXXX.  


If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.  

In your report please include:  

*	Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
*	Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
*	When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
*	Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
*	Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
*	If you believe this incident is ongoing.
*	Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?
You will receive an email acknowledging receipt within three days.   
The working group will meet to review the incident and determine:  
*	What happened.
*	Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
*	Who the bad actor was.
*	Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.  

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.  

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:  

*	Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
*	A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
*	A public reprimand.
*	An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a participation).
*	A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Kiosk spaces.
*	A request for a public or private apology.  
	
Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We will take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

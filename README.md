# project-management
This repository holds all issues and projects that are project management only. 

The repository's projects consist either of 
- issues entirely related to project management (setting it up, organizing workflows etc.) or of
- tracking issues, which are issues that just bundle more concrete issues from other repositories to a major goal of our project. 

Depending on the type of issue they live in these repositories:

- The mere project management tasks should be stored in the project-management repos itself.
- The concrete issues (tasks) should be in the repository within which the actual work will happen.

This is confusing? Yes. I just can't think of a less confusing way.

# project-management
This repository holds all issues and projects that are project management only. 

The repository's projects consist either of issues entirely related to project management (setting it up, organizing workflows etc.) and of tracking issues, which are issues that just bundle more concrete issues from other repositories to a major goal of our project. The concrete issues (tasks) should be in the repository within which the actual work will happen.

# project-management
This repository holds all issues and projects that are project management only. 
IT IS NOT PUBLIC!

## what we keep in this repo
The repository's projects consist either of 

- issues entirely related to project management (setting it up, organizing workflows etc.) or of
- issues related to internal projects that are not necessary Kiosk related (like Abydos project management, which should in fact not even be part of the kiosk organization, but ... )
- tracking issues, which are issues that just bundle more concrete issues from other repositories to a major goal of our project. 

Depending on their type issues live in these repositories:

- The mere project management tasks should be stored in the project-management repos itself.
- The concrete issues (tasks) should be in the repository within which the actual work will happen.

## how we organize our work
This guide remindes us what tools and files we use especially during planning, customization and documentation:
